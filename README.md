## Summary of Project
This is a Data analysis with visual representation using Streamlit, hosted on Heroku. 
It's about the statistics of Covid-19 in Singapore, last updated on April 2020. I am aware of the uncompleteness of the data (such as large amounts of NaN). However this is
the best that I could find at the moment. If you have a better and larger dataset, please feel free to share around. Thank You.
